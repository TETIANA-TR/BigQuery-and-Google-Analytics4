- SQL query for a table tracking conversions from session start to purchase.
- **Metrics:** `user_sessions_count`, `visit_to_cart`, `visit_to_checkout`, `visit_to_purchase`
- **SQL file:** [ed726f5f7e5d7568e1fdab4e26040ec835120ca](https://github.com/TETIANA-TR/SQL/commit/2ed726f5f7e5d7568e1fdab4e26040ec835120ca)]

## 3. Engagement vs Purchase Correlation (Hard Level)
